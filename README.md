# AppMan My Playlist 2020

I am a customer who want you to build an application about creating playlist (like spotify) with the following requirements: 

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|:---|:---|
|As a registered user, I am required to login so that I can access the application.||
|As a registered user, I want to see the create button so that I can create the playlist.||
|As a registered user, I want to see the song list so that I can add the song to my playlist.||
|As a registered user, I want to see random recommended song so that I can select the difference song.||
|As a registered user, I want to manage the playlist so that I can add or remove the song anytime.||
|As a registered user, I want to know how long of my playlist so that I can see the total duration of the playlist.||


## Also, we already prepared some stuff for you!!! :D
